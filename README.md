## Table of contents

## Overview

This is the first publish of my solution to the challenge. It has not been optimized for mobile yet.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

(- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size)

- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

## My process

I started by creating divs to nest all the content. The next step was adding in all the content (including Images) to the html, already thinking of a structure. My next step was creating the general layout. Upon that I started applying the correct fonts, text-colors and font-sizes.
I now began to finalize the correct layout using a grid-system and added paddings to re-create the given design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

I will focus on creating proper mobile-optimization next.
